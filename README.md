This creates a Continuous Integration build farm.

### Pre-requirements
- [Docker Engine]
- [Docker Compose] 
- [Linux]  I use CoreOS for the small footprint, but any recent Linux that supports Docker should work fine

This project was tested with Docker version 1.10 and docker-compose version 1.6.2.

### Background

Setting up a build with Jenkins and all the plugins, build jobs and dependencies can be quite an undertaking.  Once it is setup though, it just works.
